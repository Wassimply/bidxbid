Getting Started With BidXBid Electronic Auctions Service


= Introduction =
This is a step by step guide for getting started with BidXBid Web services.
BidXBid provides Auctions web service designed to specifically implement a general trading arena between automated brokers.
Those brokers can trade digital and non digital goods and can be conducted on behalf of third parties or by a buying/selling software broker.


BidXBid provides the following capabilities:
 * Auctioning
 * Bidding
 * Auction and Bidding

examples of usage for the above capabilities:

Auctioning will be conducted by an entity the would like to sell some digital asset, lets say a picture taken in some certain event, with defined parameters [date, location etc.], with unknown price.

Bidding will be conducted by some entity that would like to purchase a digital asset (e.g. 100G for month on someones computer) 

Auction and Bidding will be normally created by some service provider just like [http://adwords.google.com Google AdWords] conducting an auction for each advertisement based on general pricing parameters of the costumers, buying advertisements in pages or search results containing words that are in their advertisement domain.

_Note that those examples refer to demand while the framework also supports supply auction as well_

= Code Example =
{{{

public class BidXBidExapmle 
{

	protected void remoteStandardAuction() {
		String email = "my@email.com";
		String secret = "dsafs786^&%^fggfgh";
		
		Globals.instance().setUserEmail(email);
		Globals.instance().setSecretKey(secret);
		
		//create the auction
		AuctionType auctionType = new AuctionType(AuctionPrimaryType.ENGLISH);
		auctionType.addSecondaryType(new SecondaryParam(AuctionSecondaryType.SUPPLY, 1d));
		auctionType.addPrimeryParam(PrimeryParamType.START_PRICE, 10d);
		auctionType.addPrimeryParam(PrimeryParamType.DELTA_PRICE, 0.001d);

		//add the items for sale 
		List<Item> items = new ArrayList<Item>();

		Auction auction = new Auction("EnglishTest", email,
				auctionType, items, "English auction test", new Date(),
				new DateTime().plusSeconds(200).toDate());

		//create auctioneer
		AuctioneerProxy auctioneerProxy = new AuctioneerProxy();
		Auctioneer auctioneer	= auctioneerProxy.createAndRegisterAuction(auction, secret);
		//run/conduct the auction and get the results
		auctioneer = auctioneerProxy.run(auctioneer);
		
		System.out.println(auction);
	}
}
