Getting Started With BidXBid Electronic Auctions Service


= Introduction =
This is a step by step guide for getting started with BidXBid Web services.
BidXBid provides Auctions web service designed to specifically implement a general trading arena between automated brokers.
Those brokers can trade digital and non digital goods and can be conducted on behalf of third parties or by a buying/selling software broker.


BidXBid provides the following capabilities:
 * Auctioning
 * Bidding
 * Auction and Bidding

examples of usage for the above capabilities:

Auctioning will be conducted by an entity the would like to sell some digital asset, lets say a picture taken in some certain event, with defined parameters [date,occasion etc], with unknown price.

Bidding will be conducted by some entity that would like to purchase a digital asset (e.g. 100G for month on someones computer) 

Auction and Bidding will be normally created by some service provider just like [http://adwords.google.com Google AdWords] conducting an auction for each advertisement based on general pricing parameters of the costumers, buying advertisements in pages or search results containing words that are in their advertisement domain.

_Note that those examples refer to demand while the framework also supports supply auction as well_
